# Azure Storage to AWS S3

[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FJamesB-87%2FAzure-Blob-to-S3%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2Fazure.deploy.json)




This is a solution based on Azure Functions to transfer Azure Blob Storage files to AWS S3. 
For files placed into the 'Live' folder, it will copy these to an AWS S3 bucket, it will copy to an S3 bucket with Object lock enabled also (redeveloped for this). The scheduled trigger will also run aginst the 'Live' & 'Archive' folder every hour to check for files older than 60 days before deleting them.
On an hourly trigger, files placed into the 'Scheduled' folder get copied to the S3 Bucket and moved from the 'Scheduled' folder to the 'Archive' folder

The architecture of the solution is as depicted on the following diagram:

![Artitectural Diagram](./assets/AzStorage-to-AwsS3.png?raw=true)

## The role of each component
* **Azure Function** -responsible to manage the file tranfer with two approaches:
    * **BlobTrigger**: whenever a file is added on the referenced container (named 'live' by default), it causes the execution of the function to tranfer it to an AWS S3 bucket
    * **TimeTrigger**: runs in predefined time intervals tranfers all files from Azure Storage container (named 'scheduled' by default) towards AWS S3 bucket, which are then moved to an archive container (named 'archive'😊)
* **Azure Key Vault** responsible to securely store the secrets/credentials for AWS S3 and Az Data Storage Account
* **Application Insights** to provide monitoring and visibility for the health and performance of the application
* **Data Storage Account** the Storage Account that will contain the application data / blob files

**Note:** The external services / application (greyed out on the diagram using Data Factory as an example) generating the data in the Storage Account are not included.

As an example, below are the resources created when running the deployment with project: *'blobtos3'* and environment: *'dev'*

## S3 Bucket Configuration
* **S3 Bucket Policy**: S3 Bucket requires a user created and not using root account, access key is generated under the IAM for said user
                        The S3 bucket will require only an access policy and does not require any changes to make the bucket publicly availble
                        Access policy: 
                            "{
                                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                                "Id": "Policy1676627176428",
                                "Statement": [
                                    {
                                        "Sid": "Stmt1676627173502",
                                        "Effect": "Allow",
                                        "Principal": {
                                            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::#############:user/USERNAME"
                                        },
                                        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                                        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::S£BUCKETNAME/*"
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                            "

* **S3 Bucket Region Settings**: Hardcoded to us London region, update line 18 in the config.cs under src/azstoragetransfer/azstoragetransfer.funcapp - 'public static RegionEndpoint Region { get; } = RegionEndpoint.GetBySystemName(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AwsRegion") ?? RegionEndpoint.EUWest2.SystemName);' & local.settings.stub.json on line 14 - '    "AwsRegion": "eu-west-2"'
